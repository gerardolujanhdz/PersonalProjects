# Soccer Match Prediction Model

Enclosed in this folder is all the work I did on Ligue Un Match data as well as visualizations.

**TL;dr**
- ML Project seeking to identify the key features that influence the outcome of soccer matches
- Goal: Build a Machine Learning Classifier Model to predict the outcome of soccer matches.

## Introduction
In this notebook, I'll perform a lot of the steps that one might see in a typical Data Pipeline. Cleaning the data, feature engineering, etc. As well as a
Exploratory Data Analysis exploring the relationship between the features in the dataset and the result of a given soccer match. Ultimately attempting to 
identify significant features to build a ML Classifier Model.

## Problem Statement
Given access to match data and relevant team metrics (FIFA Ratings, Team Market Value, Form, etc.) can we identify trends in match outcomes and more 
importantly, can we find an explanation for these trends. To accomplish this task, we will use a datast put together by my from various sources.
