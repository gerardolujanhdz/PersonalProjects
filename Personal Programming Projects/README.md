# Programming Projects

### About Me

I first started programming when I transitioned from Emory's Business School to the Quantitative Sciences program. Deciding to supplement my statistical foundation with technical skills through picking up a minor in Computer Informatics and involving myself in Emory's Data Science Club as well as doing some personal projects of my own.

This repository holds all of my projects that I've done as a programmer. Categorized by language and sub-categorized by project type.
